<title> Poem 1b</title> </head><body><hr /><p>Last night whistling I passed<br/>
by their alley, saw them in a<br/>
sidelong blink of light from<br/>
traffic, a speeding car, then<br/>
I went home. Dreamed of<br/>
gold skies, black money.  I<br/>
felt so stupid, to talk<br/>
about them feels stupid.  I’m<br/>
the sullen red Sun.<p></body></html>
